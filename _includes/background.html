      I'm currently an graduate student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://ucsd.edu" target="_blank">UC San Diego</a>, exploring Computer Vision and Computer Networks. I recently completed my undergraduate education from
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.iitd.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</a> after having co-founded my startup
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://pharmart.in/" target="_blank">Pharmart</a> and an awesome internship at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. I breifly also worked at some really amazing problems at <a class="underline-link" href="https://rivigo.com" target="_blank">Rivigo</a>.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy applying my technical knowledge to solve challenging problems. I wish to technology as an enabler for a better lifestyle.
      My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably learning to surf, cruising around on my penny board,
      or exploring San Diego.
